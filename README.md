When you've seen the following error:

```
No module named dbus
```

Then try to install `python-dbus`! On Ubuntu you can do it as follows:

```
sudo apt-get install python-dbus
```

If you are using another distro, then try to install `python-dbus` with your package manager.

usage with tmux
---------------

If you want to use this script in your tmux panel, you can check [tmux-plugin-spotify](https://github.com/pwittchen/tmux-plugin-spotify).

code formatting
---------------

Source code should be formatted according to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guides.

Install [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) and [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) as follows:

```
pip install --upgrade autopep8
pip install --upgrade pycodestyle
```

Then run:

```
make format
```

to verify code formatting, type:

```
make check_format
```

releasing
---------

configure your `~/.pypirc` file as follows:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
[pypi]
username:yourusername
password:yourpassword
```

next, install [twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine):

```
pip install twine
```

then, update version in `setup.py` file and use wrapper in a `Makefile`:

```
make dist
make release
make clean
```
